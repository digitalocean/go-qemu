##
# @SHUTDOWN:
#
# Emitted when the virtual machine has shut down, indicating that qemu is
# about to exit.
#
# @guest: If true, the shutdown was triggered by a guest request (such as
# a guest-initiated ACPI shutdown request or other hardware-specific action)
# rather than a host request (such as sending qemu a SIGINT). (since 2.10)
#
# Note: If the command-line option "-no-shutdown" has been specified, qemu will
# not exit, and a STOP event will eventually follow the SHUTDOWN event
#
# Since: 0.12.0
#
# Example:
#
# <- { "event": "SHUTDOWN", "data": { "guest": true },
#      "timestamp": { "seconds": 1267040730, "microseconds": 682951 } }

# @RESET:
#
# Emitted when the virtual machine is reset
#
# @guest: If true, the reset was triggered by a guest request (such as
# a guest-initiated ACPI reboot request or other hardware-specific action)
# rather than a host request (such as the QMP command system_reset).
# (since 2.10)
#
# Since: 0.12.0
#
# Example:
#
# <- { "event": "RESET", "data": { "guest": false },

#      "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344456160, "microseconds": 309119 } }
#
##
{
  "event": "SUSPEND"
}

##
# @SUSPEND_DISK:
#
# Emitted when guest enters a hardware suspension state with data saved on
# disk, for example, S4 state, which is sometimes called hibernate state
#
# Note: QEMU shuts down (similar to event @SHUTDOWN) when entering this state
#
# Since: 1.2
#
# Example:
#
# <-   { "event": "SUSPEND_DISK",
#        "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344456160, "microseconds": 309119 } }

# @WATCHDOG:
#
# Emitted when the watchdog device's timer is expired
#
# @action: action that has been taken

# Since: 0.13.0
#
# Example:
#
# <- { "event": "WATCHDOG",

# @base:   The file name of the backing image to write data into.

#
# @top:    The file name of the backing image within the image chain,
#                    which contains the topmost data to be committed down. If
#                    not specified, this is the active layer.
#
# @backing-file:  The backing file string to write into the overlay
#                           image of 'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer,
#                           specifying a backing file string is an error. This
#                           filename is not validated.
#
#                           If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
#                           resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                           HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
#                           question, as filename lookup methods will fail.
#
#                           If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
#                           the backing file string to use, or error out if
#                           there is no obvious choice. Care should be taken
#                           when specifying the string, to specify a valid
#                           filename or protocol.
#                           (Since 2.1)
#
#                    If top == base, that is an error.
#                    If top == active, the job will not be completed by itself,
#                    user needs to complete the job with the block-job-complete
#                    command after getting the ready event. (Since 2.0)
#
#                    If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
#                    will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is
#                    smaller than the base image, the base will not be
#                    truncated.  If you want the base image size to match the
#                    size of the smaller top, you can safely truncate it
#                    yourself once the commit operation successfully completes.

# @filter-node-name: the node name that should be assigned to the

# @block-stream:
#
# Copy data from a backing file into a block device.
#
# The block streaming operation is performed in the background until the entire
# backing file has been copied.  This command returns immediately once streaming
# has started.  The status of ongoing block streaming operations can be checked
# with query-block-jobs.  The operation can be stopped before it has completed
# using the block-job-cancel command.
#
# The node that receives the data is called the top image, can be located in
# any part of the chain (but always above the base image; see below) and can be
# specified using its device or node name. Earlier qemu versions only allowed
# 'device' to name the top level node; presence of the 'base-node' parameter
# during introspection can be used as a witness of the enhanced semantics
# of 'device'.
#
# If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that base file and
# its backing chain.  When streaming completes the image file will have the base
# file as its backing file.  This can be used to stream a subset of the backing
# file chain instead of flattening the entire image.
#
# On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the backing file
# and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.
#
# @job-id: identifier for the newly-created block job. If
#          omitted, the device name will be used. (Since 2.7)
#
# @device: the device or node name of the top image
#
# @base:   the common backing file name.
#                    It cannot be set if @base-node is also set.
#
# @base-node: the node name of the backing file.
#                       It cannot be set if @base is also set. (Since 2.8)
#
# @backing-file: The backing file string to write into the top
#                          image. This filename is not validated.
#
#                          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
#                          resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                          HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
#                          question, as filename lookup methods will fail.
#
#                          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
#                          the backing file string to use, or error out if there
#                          is no obvious choice.  Care should be taken when
#                          specifying the string, to specify a valid filename or
#                          protocol.
#                          (Since 2.1)

# @speed:  the maximum speed, in bytes per second

# @blockdev-open-tray:
#
# Opens a block device's tray. If there is a block driver state tree inserted as
# a medium, it will become inaccessible to the guest (but it will remain
# associated to the block device, so closing the tray will make it accessible
# again).
#
# If the tray was already open before, this will be a no-op.
#
# Once the tray opens, a DEVICE_TRAY_MOVED event is emitted. There are cases in
# which no such event will be generated, these include:
# - if the guest has locked the tray, @force is false and the guest does not
#   respond to the eject request
# - if the BlockBackend denoted by @device does not have a guest device attached
#   to it
# - if the guest device does not have an actual tray
#
# @device: Block device name (deprecated, use @id instead)
#
# @id:     The name or QOM path of the guest device (since: 2.8)
#
# @force:  if false (the default), an eject request will be sent to
#          the guest if it has locked the tray (and the tray will not be opened
#          immediately); if true, the tray will be opened regardless of whether

# translate logical CHS to physical; instead, they will use logical
# block addressing.
#
# @auto: If cylinder/heads/sizes are passed, choose between none and LBA
#        depending on the size of the disk.  If they are not passed,
#        choose none if QEMU can guess that the disk had 16 or fewer
#        heads, large if QEMU can guess that the disk had 131072 or
#        fewer tracks across all heads (i.e. cylinders*heads<131072),
#        otherwise LBA.
#
# @none: The physical disk geometry is equal to the logical geometry.
#
# @lba: Assume 63 sectors per track and one of 16, 32, 64, 128 or 255
#       heads (if fewer than 255 are enough to cover the whole disk
#       with 1024 cylinders/head).  The number of cylinders/head is

#         15-head, by proportionally scaling up the number of

##
# @MigrationCapability:
#
# Migration capabilities enumeration
#
# @xbzrle: Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length Encoding).
#          This feature allows us to minimize migration traffic for certain work
#          loads, by sending compressed difference of the pages
#
# @rdma-pin-all: Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
#          mlock()'d on demand or all at once. Refer to docs/rdma.txt for usage.
#          Disabled by default. (since 2.0)
#
# @zero-blocks: During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently. This
#          essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire. Enabling requires
#          source and target VM to support this feature. To enable it is sufficient
#          to enable the capability on the source VM. The feature is disabled by
#          default. (since 1.6)
#
# @compress: Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
#          This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by sending
#          compressed pages. Please note that if compress and xbzrle are both
#          on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk stage, after that,
#          it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes effect, this can help to
#          minimize migration traffic. The feature is disabled by default.
#          (since 2.4 )
#
# @events: generate events for each migration state change
#          (since 2.4 )
#
# @auto-converge: If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest
#          to speed up convergence of RAM migration. (since 1.6)
#
# @postcopy-ram: Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
#          been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed. NOTE: If
#          the migration fails during postcopy the VM will fail.  (since 2.6)
#
# @x-colo: If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM on the
#        primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on secondary
#        side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck Stepping (COLO) for
#        Non-stop Service. (since 2.8)
#
# @release-ram: if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the source
#        during postcopy-ram migration. (since 2.9)
#
# @block: If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
#          devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
#          mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
#          offers more flexibility.
#          (Since 2.10)
#
# @return-path: If enabled, migration will use the return path even
#               for precopy. (since 2.10)
#
# @pause-before-switchover: Pause outgoing migration before serialising device
#          state and before disabling block IO (since 2.11)
#
# @x-multifd: Use more than one fd for migration (since 2.11)
#
# Since: 1.2

# @MigrationParameter:
#
# Migration parameters enumeration
#
# @compress-level: Set the compression level to be used in live migration,
#          the compression level is an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means
#          no compression, 1 means the best compression speed, and 9 means best
#          compression ratio which will consume more CPU.
#
# @compress-threads: Set compression thread count to be used in live migration,
#          the compression thread count is an integer between 1 and 255.
#
# @decompress-threads: Set decompression thread count to be used in live
#          migration, the decompression thread count is an integer between 1
#          and 255. Usually, decompression is at least 4 times as fast as
#          compression, so set the decompress-threads to the number about 1/4
#          of compress-threads is adequate.
#
# @cpu-throttle-initial: Initial percentage of time guest cpus are throttled
#                        when migration auto-converge is activated. The
#                        default value is 20. (Since 2.7)
#
# @cpu-throttle-increment: throttle percentage increase each time
#                          auto-converge detects that migration is not making
#                          progress. The default value is 10. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-creds: ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials for
#             establishing a TLS connection over the migration data channel.
#             On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials must
#             be for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
#             credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint. Setting this
#             will enable TLS for all migrations. The default is unset,
#             resulting in unsecured migration at the QEMU level. (Since 2.7)
#
# @tls-hostname: hostname of the target host for the migration. This is
#                required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
#                migration URI does not already include a hostname. For

#
# @base:   The file name of the backing image to write data into.

#
# @top:    The file name of the backing image within the image chain,
#                    which contains the topmost data to be committed down. If
#                    not specified, this is the active layer.
#
# @backing-file:  The backing file string to write into the overlay
#                           image of 'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer,
#                           specifying a backing file string is an error. This

#
#                           If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
#                           resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                           HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
#                           question, as filename lookup methods will fail.
#
#                           If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
#                           the backing file string to use, or error out if
#                           there is no obvious choice. Care should be taken
#                           when specifying the string, to specify a valid
#                           filename or protocol.
#                           (Since 2.1)
#
#                    If top == base, that is an error.
#                    If top == active, the job will not be completed by itself,
#                    user needs to complete the job with the block-job-complete
#                    command after getting the ready event. (Since 2.0)
#
#                    If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
#                    will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is
#                    smaller than the base image, the base will not be
#                    truncated.  If you want the base image size to match the
#                    size of the smaller top, you can safely truncate it

# @block-stream:
#
# Copy data from a backing file into a block device.
#
# The block streaming operation is performed in the background until the entire
# backing file has been copied.  This command returns immediately once streaming
# has started.  The status of ongoing block streaming operations can be checked
# with query-block-jobs.  The operation can be stopped before it has completed
# using the block-job-cancel command.
#
# The node that receives the data is called the top image, can be located in
# any part of the chain (but always above the base image; see below) and can be
# specified using its device or node name. Earlier qemu versions only allowed
# 'device' to name the top level node; presence of the 'base-node' parameter
# during introspection can be used as a witness of the enhanced semantics
# of 'device'.
#
# If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that base file and
# its backing chain.  When streaming completes the image file will have the base
# file as its backing file.  This can be used to stream a subset of the backing
# file chain instead of flattening the entire image.
#
# On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the backing file
# and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.
#
# @job-id: identifier for the newly-created block job. If
#          omitted, the device name will be used. (Since 2.7)
#
# @device: the device or node name of the top image
#
# @base:   the common backing file name.
#                    It cannot be set if @base-node is also set.
#
# @base-node: the node name of the backing file.
#                       It cannot be set if @base is also set. (Since 2.8)
#
# @backing-file: The backing file string to write into the top
#                          image. This filename is not validated.
#
#                          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be
#                          resolved by QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or
#                          HMP commands must use node-names for the image in
#                          question, as filename lookup methods will fail.
#
#                          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine
#                          the backing file string to use, or error out if there
#                          is no obvious choice.  Care should be taken when
#                          specifying the string, to specify a valid filename or
#                          protocol.
#                          (Since 2.1)

# @transaction:
#
# Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically. If any
# operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be abandoned and the

#
# For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the file to use for
# the new snapshot, and the format.  The default format, if not specified, is
# qcow2.
#
# Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
# contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to reuse
# an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should ensure that
# the new image file has the same contents as the current one; QEMU cannot
# perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is achieved by using the
# current image file as the backing file for the new image.
#
# On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.
#
# For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the snapshot's
# name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already exists, the request will
# be rejected.  Only some image formats support it, for example, qcow2, rbd,
# and sheepdog.
#
# On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal snapshot in the
# transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during deletion, the user needs to fix
# it later with qemu-img or other command.
#
# @actions: List of @TransactionAction;

# @properties: structure of additional options to control the

#              for additional detail.
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#
#          Errors depend on the operations of the transaction
#
# Note: The transaction aborts on the first failure.  Therefore, there will be
# information on only one failed operation returned in an error condition, and

# @query-qmp-schema:
#
# Command query-qmp-schema exposes the QMP wire ABI as an array of
# SchemaInfo.  This lets QMP clients figure out what commands and
# events are available in this QEMU, and their parameters and results.
#
# However, the SchemaInfo can't reflect all the rules and restrictions
# that apply to QMP.  It's interface introspection (figuring out
# what's there), not interface specification.  The specification is in
# the QAPI schema.
#
# Furthermore, while we strive to keep the QMP wire format
# backwards-compatible across qemu versions, the introspection output
# is not guaranteed to have the same stability.  For example, one
# version of qemu may list an object member as an optional
# non-variant, while another lists the same member only through the
# object's variants; or the type of a member may change from a generic
# string into a specific enum or from one specific type into an
# alternate that includes the original type alongside something else.
#
# Returns: array of @SchemaInfo, where each element describes an
# entity in the ABI: command, event, type, ...
#
# The order of the various SchemaInfo is unspecified; however, all
# names are guaranteed to be unique (no name will be duplicated with
# different meta-types).
#
# Note: the QAPI schema is also used to help define *internal*
# interfaces, by defining QAPI types.  These are not part of the QMP
# wire ABI, and therefore not returned by this command.

# Since:  0.14.0
#
# Notes:  This function will succeed even if the guest is already in the stopped
#         state.  In "inmigrate" state, it will ensure that the guest

#        2) A child type in the form 'child<subtype>' where subtype is a qdev
#           device type name.  Child properties create the composition tree.
#
#        3) A link type in the form 'link<subtype>' where subtype is a qdev

# @qom-get:
#
# This command will get a property from a object model path and return the
# value.
#
# @path: The path within the object model.  There are two forms of supported
#        paths--absolute and partial paths.
#
#        Absolute paths are derived from the root object and can follow child<>
#        or link<> properties.  Since they can follow link<> properties, they
#        can be arbitrarily long.  Absolute paths look like absolute filenames
#        and are prefixed  with a leading slash.
#
#        Partial paths look like relative filenames.  They do not begin
#        with a prefix.  The matching rules for partial paths are subtle but
#        designed to make specifying objects easy.  At each level of the
#        composition tree, the partial path is matched as an absolute path.
#        The first match is not returned.  At least two matches are searched
#        for.  A successful result is only returned if only one match is
#        found.  If more than one match is found, a flag is return to
#        indicate that the match was ambiguous.
#
# @property: The property name to read
#
# Returns: The property value.  The type depends on the property
#          type. child<> and link<> properties are returned as #str
#          pathnames.  All integer property types (u8, u16, etc) are
#          returned as #int.

#          change password command.   Otherwise, this specifies a new server URI
#          address to listen to for VNC connections.
#
# @arg:    If @device is a block device, then this is an optional format to open
#          the device with.
#          If @device is 'vnc' and @target is 'password', this is the new VNC

##
# @dump-guest-memory:
#
# Dump guest's memory to vmcore. It is a synchronous operation that can take
# very long depending on the amount of guest memory.
#
# @paging: if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping. This allows
#          using gdb to process the core file.
#
#          IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several gigabytes
#                     of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
#                     malicious guest pretending to be large.
#
#          Also, paging=true has the following limitations:
#
#             1. The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have corrupted
#                memory, which cannot be trusted
#             2. The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled. For
#                example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep state
#                goes in real-mode
#             3. Currently only supported on i386 and x86_64.
#
# @protocol: the filename or file descriptor of the vmcore. The supported
#            protocols are:
#
#            1. file: the protocol starts with "file:", and the following
#               string is the file's path.
#            2. fd: the protocol starts with "fd:", and the following string
#               is the fd's name.
#
# @detach: if true, QMP will return immediately rather than
#          waiting for the dump to finish. The user can track progress
#          using "query-dump". (since 2.6).
#
# @begin: if specified, the starting physical address.
#
# @length: if specified, the memory size, in bytes. If you don't
#          want to dump all guest's memory, please specify the start @begin
#          and @length
#
# @format: if specified, the format of guest memory dump. But non-elf
#          format is conflict with paging and filter, ie. @paging, @begin and
#          @length is not allowed to be specified with non-elf @format at the
